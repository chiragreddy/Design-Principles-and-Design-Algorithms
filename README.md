DESIGN PRINCIPLES:

	Design Principles are the guidelines which help us to improve our object oriented design

Principles-1

1. Encapsulate what varies
2. Composition Over Inheritance
3. Loose Coupling
4. Program to Interfaces

Principles-2

1. Single Responsibility Principle
2. Open/Closed Principle
3. Liskov Substitution Principle
4. Interface Segregation Principle
5. Dependency Inversion Principle

DESIGN PATTERNS: (Gang of Four - GoF)

	Design patterns are the solutions for the common design challenges and existing object oriented problems. So, it helps us to write more maintainable code as 
the software requirements are always changing.

1. Creational  
	Desing patterns which help us to create/construct or get new instances of a class.
	a. Singleton - Used when the class should only ever have one instance which can be accessible through out the application.
	b. Prototype
	c. Factory

2. Behavioral
	a. Strategy 
	b. Observer
	c. Iterator

3. Structural
	a. Decorator
